        <p>Hello, my name is Mason Shields. I have a bachelors degree from West Texas A&M University in Theater Performance. I have been involved in theater since my 
          time in high school. It is a field that I am very passtionate about and look forward to having a job in this field in the future. I am open to working in
          any aspect of theater, but here are some specifics that most interest me.</p><br>
        <h2>Actor</h2>
        <img src="img/theatermasks.png" title="theatermasks" alt="theatermasks" width="200px" height="200px" class="borderleft">
        <p>The main job that involves my field of study directly is an actor. I currently have a degree with an emphasis in performing, so that would be the main
            field that my degree is relevant for. This is a job that I control since I have to audition for shows and movies and I plan to audition as much as I can. 
            I hope to be able to get as many opportunities that I can while auditioning and pursue many different roles on stage and in film/TV.</p><br>
        <h2>Costume Designer</h2>
        <img src="img/thread.png" title="thread" alt="thread" width="200px" height="200px" class="borderright">
         <p>Another job I would love to have in theater is costume designer. Costuming is something I've come to love doing since having the formal training through my
          classes at WT. Creating costumes and seeing people in my creations is a great joy for me. I love being able to see my work being used on stage and in 
          performances. 
         </p><br>
        <h2>Teacher</h2>
        <img src="img/teacher.png" title="teacher" alt="teacher" width="200px" height="150px" class="borderleft">
        <p>The final job I have interest in pursuing in theater is a teacher. I love the idea of being able to teach theater to the younger generation and be able to
          share the passion I have with others. I would love to go into teaching high school with my end goal being to teach college.Teaching is an opportunity to
          bring everything that I have learned related to theater all into one profession and be able to use it all effectively while I teach others to do the same.
