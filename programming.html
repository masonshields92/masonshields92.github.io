   <h1 class="intro">Freelance Programming</h1>
   <br>
    <div class="limit">
        <p>Along with my pursuit of theater and teaching, I also offer programming services. I build simple websites from the ground up with 24/7 continued support
            to keep the website up to date and active. I will host the website, but if a domain is desired, the client will need to purchase one themselves that I will
            then attach to the website.<br><br>
            I keep continued communication with the client and show progress as the website is being built. The client has the final say on how the website looks and 
            will always be able to add their own flare into it. I am always open to fixing or changing things as they arise and as the client wants.<br><br>
            Some sample websites I've made include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My own portfolio website that you are currently on</li>
            <li><a href="https://authorkenziegraves.github.io/" rel="noopener norefferer" target="_blank">Author Kenzie Graves</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://randomoscityediting.github.io/" rel="noopener norefferer" target="_blank">Randomoscity Editing</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prices are decided after the initial consultation. The price of labor, continued support, and what goes into the website is all taken into consideration
            when deciding.
